# Light diffreaction on a slit
<b> The second semester of my bachelor studies at CTU </br>
My semestral work for course of Physics </b>

I have found this project from my fist semester at university and as well my first year of programming and decided to publish it. It was awesome to go back to my programming roots to see how I coded. I had to translate it from Czech to english plus I added config file but he rest is the same as I wrote it 4 years ago. I realized how much I learned from the time.
